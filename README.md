# Deep_Learning_NLP

This repository was used to record and review the NLP python code.

All the code came from a book and I also added some comments. This book was "Advanced Deep Learning: Natural language processing" in English, written by a Japanese - Koki Saitoh. His Twitter: 斎藤康毅 (@SaitohKoki)

This was much more difficult, harder and complexer than the former one, which was named as "Introduction to Deep learning: Python-based theory and implementation". However, I will try my best to read and understand the code or structure of NLP.

Note: The code in this repository could be shared but not for commercial use.

The code in the file named "book_given_fucntion.py" was directly copied and paste from the book. But the rest of code was totally understood and could be explained clearly by myself.

# Always remember: Practice makes perfect.
