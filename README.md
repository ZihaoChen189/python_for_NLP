# Deep_Learning_NLP

This repository was used to record and review the NLP python code.

All the code came from a book and I also added some comments. This book was "Advanced Deep Learning: Natural language processing" in English, written by a Japanese - Koki Saitoh. 

**His Twitter: 斎藤康毅 (@SaitohKoki)**

This book was more difficult, complex and harder than its former one, which was named "Introduction to Deep learning: Python based theory and implementation". However, I will try my best to read and understand the code or structure of NLP. By the way, I also did the note in my GitHub for the book "Introduction to Deep learning: Python based theory and implementation".

**Note: The code in this repository could be shared but not for commercial use.**

The code in files named "book_given_function.py" was copied and paste from the book. BUT the rest of code was totally understood and could be explained clearly by myself.

# Always remember: Practice makes perfect.
